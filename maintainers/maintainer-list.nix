/* List of NixOS maintainers.
    ```nix
    handle = {
      # Required
      name = "Your name";

      # Optional, but at least one of email, matrix or githubId must be given
      email = "address@example.org";
      matrix = "@user:example.org";
      github = "GithubUsername";
      githubId = your-github-id;

      keys = [{
        fingerprint = "AAAA BBBB CCCC DDDD EEEE  FFFF 0000 1111 2222 3333";
      }];
    };
    ```

    where

    - `handle` is the handle you are going to use in nixpkgs expressions,
    - `name` is a name that people would know and recognize you by,
    - `email` is your maintainer email address,
    - `matrix` is your Matrix user ID,
    - `github` is your GitHub handle (as it appears in the URL of your profile page, `https://github.com/<userhandle>`),
    - `githubId` is your GitHub user ID, which can be found at `https://api.github.com/users/<userhandle>`,
    - `keys` is a list of your PGP/GPG key fingerprints.

    Specifying a GitHub account ensures that you automatically:
    - get invited to the @NixOS/nixpkgs-maintainers team ;
    - once you are part of the @NixOS org, OfBorg will request you review
      pull requests that modify a package for which you are a maintainer.

    `handle == github` is strongly preferred whenever `github` is an acceptable attribute name and is short and convenient.

    If `github` begins with a numeral, `handle` should be prefixed with an underscore.
    ```nix
    _1example = {
      github = "1example";
    };
    ```

    Add PGP/GPG keys only if you actually use them to sign commits and/or mail.

    To get the required PGP/GPG values for a key run
    ```shell
    gpg --fingerprint <email> | head -n 2
    ```

    !!! Note that PGP/GPG values stored here are for informational purposes only, don't use this file as a source of truth.

    More fields may be added in the future, however, in order to comply with GDPR this file should stay as minimal as possible.
